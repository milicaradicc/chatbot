\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\qj Executive Summary\par
\b0 This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the viability of an AI-powered chatbot for customer service and query-based applications. The chatbot leverages cutting-edge AI technologies such as web scraping, sentence embeddings, vector search, and Azure OpenAI language models to provide contextually relevant and accurate responses. The PoC will focus on validating the core functionality of the chatbot, including web content extraction, semantic search, and AI-powered responses.\par
\b Problem Statement\par
\b0 In today's digital landscape, searching for and quickly retrieving relevant information from large volumes of textual data can be challenging and time-consuming. Many organizations store large datasets in the form of documents such as manuals, reports, guides, or internal files. However, accessing specific information within these documents often requires extensive manual effort and time.\par
The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that utilizes advanced search and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide users with quick and accurate answers based on the information contained in specific files. This chatbot will be capable of responding to user queries using content from existing documents (which can be considered "expert" or "knowledgeable" sources) without the need for manual file searches.\par
By implementing this solution, users will be able to access relevant information from existing files more efficiently, thus improving productivity and task execution.\par
\b Objectives\par
\b0 Test the AI\rquote s ability to fetch and process text from URLs using web scraping techniques.\par
Evaluate the chatbot\rquote s semantic search capability by measuring its accuracy in understanding and responding to customer queries.\par
Assess the performance of the chatbot in delivering contextually relevant and accurate responses using Azure OpenAI models.\par
\b Scope\par
\b0 Web Content Extraction: The chatbot will be able to respond to questions using information extracted from the URLs provided.\par
Data Processing Limitations: The chatbot will only be able to answer questions related to the content available on those URLs. If a question is asked that is not covered by the provided material, the chatbot will not be able to provide an answer.\par
Cannot Process Images: The chatbot will not be able to analyze or respond to images or other multimedia content; it will be limited solely to the text-based content from the URLs.\par
Search within Web Content: The system will use semantic search to find relevant answers from the text data on the URLs but will not be able to answer questions that are not covered by that content.\par
\b Methodology\b0\par
Web Content Extraction: Utilizes BeautifulSoup to scrape text from specified URLs.\par
Semantic Search: Sentence Transformers will generate embeddings to perform semantic search and find relevant answers from the scraped data.\par
Vector Database: Milvus will store the embeddings to facilitate fast and efficient similarity searches.\par
AI-Powered Responses: Azure OpenAI will be used to generate human-like responses based on the context of the query.\par
User Interface: Tkinter will provide a simple, interactive GUI for users to test the chatbot.\par
Steps:\par
1. Web Scraping\par
Objective: Extract relevant text-based content from specified URLs.\par
Process: Use BeautifulSoup to fetch the HTML content from the given URLs. The text will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove unnecessary elements such as HTML tags, advertisements, and navigation links.\par
2. Text Tokenization\par
Objective: Prepare the extracted text for further processing.\par
Process: Split the cleaned text into smaller, manageable tokens using tokenization techniques. This step ensures that the data is in a format suitable for embedding and semantic search. Tokenization will be done using libraries like NLTK or spaCy.\par
3. Text Embedding\par
Objective: Transform the tokenized text into meaningful vector representations.\par
Process: Use a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate embeddings for each sentence or paragraph. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and allow for efficient similarity searches.\par
4. Database Setup (Milvus)\par
Objective: Store the generated embeddings in a vector database for fast retrieval.\par
Process: Set up the Milvus vector database to store the embeddings. Milvus will allow efficient search and retrieval of semantically similar sentences based on the query input. The embeddings will be indexed in Milvus for optimized performance.\par
5. Semantic Search\par
Objective: Retrieve the most relevant responses based on user queries.\par
Process: When the user submits a query, the system will convert the query into an embedding (using the same Sentence Transformer model) and search the Milvus database to find the most similar sentences or passages from the scraped content.\par
6. AI-Powered Response Generation\par
Objective: Generate natural language responses based on the retrieved information.\par
Process: Once the relevant sentences or passages are identified, the system will use Azure OpenAI to generate a fluent and coherent response. The OpenAI model will take the most relevant retrieved data as context and generate a response tailored to the user\rquote s query.\par
7. Testing and Evaluation\par
Objective: Ensure the system\rquote s accuracy, speed, and usability.\par
Process:\par
Accuracy Evaluation: Measure the relevance and correctness of the responses by comparing them to human-provided answers.\par
Performance Testing: Evaluate response times to ensure that the system operates efficiently.\par
Semantic Search Testing: Test the ability of the system to find relevant sentences from the stored content.\par
8. User Interface (UI) Testing\par
Objective: Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to use.\par
Process:\par
UI Development: Use Tkinter to create a simple and user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot. The interface will allow users to input queries and view the chatbot's responses.\par
Usability Testing: Test the user interface with real users to ensure it is responsive and intuitive. Make necessary adjustments based on user feedback.\par
Expected Outcome\par
AI Model Integration: The chatbot will effectively leverage AI technologies for both semantic search and response generation.\par
Performance Benchmarks: The chatbot will provide relevant and accurate responses in a timely manner.\par
Usability: The Tkinter-based UI will provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.\par
\b Success Criteria\par
\b0 Response Accuracy: The chatbot will provide relevant and accurate answers only for queries that have corresponding material available in the provided URLs. If the content does not exist for the query, the chatbot will not be able to generate a response.\par
Embedding Process: The process of embedding the text from the provided URLs will take approximately 20 seconds to complete initially. This embedding is a one-time setup and will not significantly affect query performance after the initial setup.\par
Query Response Time: Each user query will be processed and responded to in a few seconds, as the system will search for relevant information in the pre-embedded content. The response time will depend on the complexity of the query and the efficiency of the semantic search.\par
UI Usability: The user interface will be intuitive and responsive, allowing users to input queries and receive answers promptly, with minimal friction.\par
\b Limitations\b0\par
The PoC will not test the chatbot\rquote s ability to handle complex, non-standard queries.\par
It will only be deployed in a controlled environment and will not be used in real-world customer service interactions.\par
\b Resources Required\par
\b0 Development Team: 2 Python developers for system integration and chatbot setup.\par
Data: Access to customer FAQ data and web content for scraping.\par
Cloud Infrastructure: Access to Azure OpenAI API for language model responses and Milvus for vector database.\par
Environment: Local setup for testing the chatbot and its functionalities.\par
\b Expected Outcomes\par
\b0 The chatbot should meet the defined accuracy and response time benchmarks.\par
The semantic search capability should be able to return relevant answers based on the user query and context.\par
\b Conclusion\par
\b0 This PoC will provide a foundational test of whether an AI-powered chatbot can effectively automate simple customer service queries using advanced AI techniques, including web scraping, semantic search, and Azure OpenAI\rquote s language models. The results from this PoC will guide decisions on scaling the chatbot for more complex use cases.\par
